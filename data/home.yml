    We are injury lawyers from a small town in West Virginia, where we grew up around hardworking people who did whatever it took to support their families. They taught us grit, determination, and the importance of standing up for what’s right – values we bring to our law practice every day. When someone is hurt because of someone else’s wrong doing, they deserve a lawyer who will fight as hard for them as they would for their own family. That’s exactly what we do.

    We focus on helping people who’ve been seriously injured – whether it’s from a truck wreck, car wreck, a dangerous property condition, or other injury. A lot of our clients are just regular folks trying to recover and get back to work, get back to supporting their families, but insurance companies don’t always treat them fairly. That’s where we come in. We walk with our clients every step of the way, handling the paperwork, the phone calls, and the fight – so that they can focus on healing. We don’t get paid unless we recover, and we work every case like it’s personal – because to our clients, it is. 

    
    We pride ourselves on being from a small-town West Virginia and going toe-to-toe and winning against the biggest law firms. We protect everything you've worked so hard to build and get you back to the life you love.

      text: When someone’s been hit by a commercial truck, the damage is often life-changing – and the legal fight can be just as tough. Trucking companies and their insurers move fast to protect themselves, but we move faster. We know how to dig into logbooks, black box data, and federal safety violations to hold these companies accountable.

      text: After a car wreck, everything changes in an instant – medical bills pile up, you’re missing work, and the insurance company is focused on paying as little as possible. We pride ourselves on stepping in to make sure our clients don’t get pushed around. We gather the evidence to build your case from day one so that you can focus on healing.

      icon: file-circle-xmark
      text: Sometimes the fight isn’t with the other driver – it’s with your own insurance company. When folks pay their premiums and get the runaround after a claim, that not just frustrating – it’s wrong. We frequently take on insurance companies that act in bad faith, delay payments, or deny valid claims.

      text: Nothing is harder than losing someone you love – especially when it didn’t have to happen. In wrongful death cases, we stand with families who are grieving and looking for answers. We dig deep to discover what really happened, hold the responsible parties accountable, and fight to make sure the family is financially protected moving forward.
