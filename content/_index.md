    Life dealt you a bad hand – maybe you're hurting physically, struggling financially, or some big insurance company is pushing you around like you don't matter. You're good people. You deserve better. And I won't stand for it.

    
    I'm here to help you fight – to protect the life you've worked so hard to build and get you back to the life you love. Just a hometown lawyer lending a hand when you need it most.

  heading: Is my case a good fit?
  intro: We take on fewer cases so we can fight harder for the people we serve. Let's talk about your case and see if we're meant to fight this battle together. If it sounds like there may be a fit, let's have an honest conversation about your case. You take 24 hours to think it over, we'll do the same – then we'll both know if it's right.
