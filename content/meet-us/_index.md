Life has a way of showing you what really matters. For me, that lesson came at 19 when I was yanked out of college at Fairmont State and sent to Afghanistan after 9/11.
Born and raised in Hampshire County, I grew up around the smartest, strongest, most hardworking people you'll ever meet – farmers, tradesmen, coal miners. Salt of the earth folks who built something real with their hands and their determination. But I never truly appreciated what I had until I left it.

The more I traveled, the more I missed home, and the people more than anything. At 19, I was just a kid chasing girls at parties, hadn't given a single thought about all these good people who made me who I am – a community that supported me, believed in me, shaped me into who I am today.

Coming home, I knew I wanted to give back to these people who gave me so much. Law wasn't my first choice – I had a computer science degree and dreams of grad school in math or physics. But those paths would have taken me away from Hampshire County. Law was my way to stay and help my people when they needed it most.

My first year practicing showed me exactly what our community doesn't need – attorneys who just go through the motions, treating clients like numbers instead of neighbors. I watched good people get pushed around by big insurance companies and powerful interests just because they didn't have someone willing to stand up and fight for them.

That's when I started my own firm. Nobody thought it was a good idea – not the other attorneys, not my friends, not even my family. But their doubt only fueled my determination. I'd seen too many people I cared about get taken advantage of just because they were from "rural West Virginia." I was tired of watching good, hardworking people lose everything they'd built because they didn't have someone in their corner who truly understood what was at stake.

Today, we're still that hometown firm that believes in treating everyone like family. We may be small, but we fight as hard as the big guys because we understand exactly what our clients stand to lose. When someone's worked their whole life to build something and it's threatened by forces beyond their control – that's not just another case to us. That's our neighbor's life, their dignity, their future.
