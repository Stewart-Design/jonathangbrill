  With roots stretching back generations in Hampshire County, Jonathan has recovered millions for good people across West Virginia, building a reputation for turning rural cases into major victories. While often coached to remain emotionally detached from clients and cases, Jonathan follows Texas trial legend Joe Jamail's wisdom: "If you are not emotionally involved, your client is not getting your best effort."


  With a strong network across the State, he helps people get the support they need when it matters most – bringing small-town values together with serious legal experience. He takes a selective approach to his cases, focusing his time and energy on standing up for people who’ve been wronged and need someone in their corner.


  Beyond the courtroom, Jonathan serves his community as a board member at both Bank of Romney and Eastern West Virginia Community College, believing that helping people means strengthening the communities. Jonathan lives in Yellow Spring with his wife, Aura, and their two children.
