  Born and raised in Romney, West Virginia, Amanda brings a strong sense of community, compassion, and hard work to her legal practice. A proud Hampshire High School graduate (Call of 2009), Amanda grew up in her family’s business, Wilson Lanes, where she learned the values of dedication and community. Her athletic talent in bowling took her to Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Missouri, on a scholarship, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice (legal studies emphasis), a Master of Business Administration (management emphasis), and a Master of Public Administration. While at Lindenwood, she completed internships with the United States Secret Service and the City of St. Charles Police Department. 


  After college, she returned home to Romney, juggling her pursuit of a professional bowling career with part-time work at Jonathan G Brill, PLLC, as a legal assistant. With encouragement and mentorship from Jonathan, she took the LSAT and was accepted into West Virginia University College of Law, where she earned her J.D. in 2020. She has been practicing with the firm ever since. 


  Outside the courtroom, Amanda is still passionate about bowling – having won two national titles on the Professional Women’s Bowling Tour. She was inducted into the Hampshire High School Athletic Hall of Fame in 2019 and the Lindenwood University Sports Hall of Fame in 2023. 


  She serves her community as Vice President of the Hampshire County Parks and Recreation, Treasurer of the Hampshire County Athletic Hall of Fame, and as a board member of the South Branch Valley Day Report Community Criminal Justice Board. 


  Approachable, determined, and deeply rooted in the local community, Amanda is committed to helping others navigate the legal system with empathy and integrity.
