## What do you think my case is worth? 

Every case is unique - we won't make promises we can't keep. Here's what we will promise: we'll invest whatever it takes, often thousands in expert testimony and research, to get you what you deserve.

## How much will this cost me? 

Simple: we only get paid when you get paid. Our fee is 1/3 of what we recover. We advance all the expenses necessary to build your case. Your win is our win.

## What else will I need to pay for?

Nothing. We invest in everything needed to build your case:

  - Medical records and analysis
  - Expert witnesses
  - Court fees and expenses
  - Case research

These costs can get expensive, but that's on us – you never pay a dime out of pocket. We only recover if you win.

## What’s expected of me?

We're particular about our cases because we want partners, not just clients:

Your Time:

  - Deep dive meetings at the start to get your full story
  - Frequent check-ins (10-15 minutes)
  - More updates during big moments
  - Being there for key meetings and court
  - Sometimes meeting evenings or weekends

Your Part:

  - Tell us your whole story, straight up
  - Stay involved in your case
  - Get back to us when it matters
  - Trust us and be patient – good cases take time to build right

## So, how long will this take?

It won’t happen overnight. We don't rush cases because we build them right. Most take at least 6 months, complex ones can run longer. 

## What areas do you serve?

Hampshire County is home, but we help good people wherever they are located. We’ve handled cases throughout West Virginia. We’ve also handled numerous civil cases in federal court. 

## What kinds of cases do you focus on?

Life changes fast. A crash, a loss, an insurance company pushing you around – these aren't just cases, they're neighbors who need someone in their corner. We focus on cases where good people need us most:

  - **Serious Injuries:** When serious injuries flip your world upside down, you need someone who gets what's really at stake. This isn't about just medical bills – it's about protecting everything you've built and getting back to providing for your family.
  - **Wrongful Death:** Nothing makes up for losing someone you love. But when it happens because someone else was careless, your family deserves justice. We're here to stand with you through this fight.
  - **Insurance Bad Faith:** Big insurance companies bet on you feeling helpless. We've seen their playbook, and we won't let them take advantage of good people. When they try to shortchange you, we're here to even the odds.

## What if I need other legal help?

We've got strong connections with the best lawyers throughout West Virginia. Need help with estate planning, taxes, or protecting your assets? We'll get you to partners we trust - folks known and respected across the state.

## How often will I hear from you?

You'll hear from us frequently. While we can't always pick up unscheduled calls, you'll never be left in the dark about your case.
