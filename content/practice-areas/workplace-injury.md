  Workplace accidents occur in many settings: constructions sites, warehouses, factories, manufacturing plants, offices and hospitals. After sustaining a serious injury, employers usually turn the case over to their insurance company, and the injured worker is left alone to struggle against an insurance defense lawyer, all the while battling lost income, financial hardship, medical bills, disability and emotional hardship. If you suffered an on-the-job injury as a result of unsafe working conditions, unsafe property, repetitive stress, a fall, or malfunctioning machinery or equipment, give us a call.
