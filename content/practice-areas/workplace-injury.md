lead: Working Hard For Injured Workplace Accident Victims In West Virginia
body: >-
  Workplace accidents occur in many settings: constructions sites, warehouses, factories, manufacturing plants, offices and hospitals. After sustaining a serious injury, employers usually turn the case over to their insurance company, and the injured worker is left alone to struggle against an insurance defense lawyer, all the while battling lost income, financial hardship, medical bills, disability and emotional hardship.


  Personal injury attorney Jonathan G. Brill has devoted his Romney, West Virginia, practice to providing injured employees and victims of personal injury with the hardworking, dedicated legal representation necessary to stand up to insurance companies and big business.
