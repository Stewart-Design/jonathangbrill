    I’m here to fight for good people like you–*my* people.

    I believe everyone deserves to be seen for who they truly are and treated with dignity, regardless of their circumstances. Growing up in Hampshire County showed us what that really means – how hard good people work to build a life worth living, and how quickly an injury can threaten to take it all away. When good people get dealt a bad hand, they deserve someone who'll fight for them with everything they've got.

      We give our all because these are our people. We take on only the cases we believe in, work as if it’s our own family at stake, build genuine connections, and stay invested until it’s made right—never letting money stand in the way.

      Small-town roots don’t mean small fights. We build every case for trial from day one, front the costs for expert testimony, master every detail, and leave no stone unturned—outworking even the biggest opponents.

      Good people don’t back down. We stand up to powerful interests, push through obstacles, and stay committed for the long haul—fighting for our neighbors until justice is served.

      I’m a good ‘ole country boy like you–Hampshire County born and bread. I understand exactly what's at stake when life deals you a bad hand. I believe everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity – no matter where they're from or what they have. 


      When good people get dealt a bad hand, they deserve someone who'll fight for them with everything they've got. Not just any lawyer, but someone who understands the kind of person they are because we're cut from the same cloth. Where others might see just another case, I see my neighbors, father figures, and the hard working men and women who made me – good people who've worked hard to build something worth protecting. That's why we don't just handle cases – we live them.

    subheading: 90% of cases turned away, 100% commitment to the rest
    text: >
      Most firms take every case that walks through their door, churning through files to maximize profit. We take a radically different approach. We'd rather turn down 90% of potential cases than give anyone less than our absolute best effort. When we believe in your case, we go all-in – emotionally and financially.


      Being selective means we can invest as much of our time and resources as needed, stay personally involved from start to finish, and work nights and weekends when inspiration strikes. From middle-of-the-night research to weekend case preparation, we're in this fight together. Because when we take your case, there's no limit to how far we'll go to make things right.

    subheading: There’s no such thing as lukewarm justice
    text: >
      Justice requires more than just legal expertise – it demands unwavering passion and the courage to stand up to powerful interests. We learned early on that lukewarm representation can be worse than no representation at all. That's what drives us to pour our heart into every case we take. If we’re not emotionally invested, you’re not getting our best work. Period.

      We don't just handle cases – we live them. When you sign with us, your fight becomes our fight. Whether it's three thousand or three million dollars at stake, we bring the same passionate dedication to righting wrongs. Because this isn't about processing paperwork or checking boxes – it's about fighting with everything we've got for people who trust us with their futures.

    subheading: We prepare to fight so you're never forced to settle
    text: >
      We may be a small-town firm, but we're not a small fight. While other firms rush to settle, treating cases like assembly-line products, we prepare every case for trial from day one. Our approach isn't just about being ready – it's about being feared. When powerful interests see our name on a case, they know we mean business.

      This means unlimited investment in expert testimony, comprehensive evidence gathering, and a willingness to stand toe-to-toe with billion-dollar behemoths.When we take your case, you get us – fully committed, personally invested, and ready to do whatever it takes. From middle-of-the-night inspiration to weekend preparation, we're in this fight together. This isn't just business for us – it's personal.
