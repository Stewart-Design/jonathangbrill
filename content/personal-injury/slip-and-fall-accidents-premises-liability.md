title: Slip-and-Fall Accidents / Premises Liability
lead: Were You Seriously Injured On Unsafe Property In West Virginia?
---

Slip-and-fall claims refer to a variety of injuries sustained on the property of others: slick walkways, sidewalks in disrepair, unsafe or unmaintained supermarket floors or other unsafe condition. And often the injury leads to unexpected medical bills, lost wages, time away from work and substantial pain.

In some instances, a premises liability claim does not arise from a fall, but instead arises from other dangerous conditions on property: a dog bite, unsafe hotel conditions and failure to properly maintain public areas. After an injury occurs, in-depth investigation is necessary to properly assess and pursue the claim; and time is important.
