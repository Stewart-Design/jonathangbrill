lead: Protecting Your Rights After Injuries Caused By Defective Products
---

Improperly manufactured or defective products frequently cause serious injury or wrongful death, through no fault of the consumer. And when a serious injury or death occurs, an experienced personal injury attorney is necessary to prevent further damage to other consumers and to ensure losses are recouped for pain and suffering, disability, lost income, medical bills, and emotional harm.

Defective product injuries usually occur as a result of a poorly manufactured product, a poorly designed product, and improperly labeled product, and products the subject of a recall. Faulty car tires, faulty truck tires, faulty car seats, faulty toys, faulty exercise equipment, faulty medical devices and dangerous drugs are some common forms of personal injury caused by defective products that may subject a manufacturer to product liability.
