lead: When Victims Of Crime Sustain Serious Injuries In Hampshire County And Statewide
---

Perhaps no injuries create more lasting and debilitating pain than becoming the victim of a crime. Victims of car accident with a drunk driver, a passenger of a driver under the influence of drugs or alcohol, a shooting, sexual assault, stabbing or robbery encounter two injuries: physical and mental. And in a worst-case scenario: death. The injuries are always undeserved.

Personal injury attorney Jonathan G. Brill works hard and dedicates himself to seeking justice for the victims of crimes, seeking reimbursement for damaged or stolen property and the pain, suffering and emotional harm associated with being the victim of a crime. Personal injury and wrongful death claims resulting from criminal actions of others require thorough preparation and aggressive pursuit of the claim.
